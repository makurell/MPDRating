# My Music Setup
- Originally, I used MusicBee and rated songs that way
- now I use MPD and ncmpcpp
- 'Ratings' are now done by arranging songs into playlists
- Exporting songs from osu: [osumusic](https://github.com/makurell/osumusic)
- Exporting MusicBee (POPM) ratings to playlists: mpdrating.py
- Backing up the playlists into Google Sheets: mpdbak.py
- Removing playlist entries that do not exist: mpdunrated.py
- Putting all songs that are not in a playlist into an 'unrated' playlist: mpdunrated.py
- Removing duplicate entries within a playlist: mpdunrated.py
- Eliminating songs in multiple playlists (TODO): mpdunrated.py
- Volume normalisation: mp3gain
- Song tagging: picard
